MCGSuite Installation

*** Requirements

MCG requires a Fortran compiler (recommended to be gfortran), cfitsio, and fftw3.
cfitsio is available at:
https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/fitsio.html

fftw3 is available at:
http://www.fftw.org

make_galaxy_MCG and make_suite_MCG require python3, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and astropy.

For convenience, versions of the cfitsio and fftw3 are contained in /third_party.



***  Full Installation

0) Configure and install cfitsio and fftw3 according to their instructions.

1) Edit /src/makeflags so that 
      a) FitsLibLoc points to libcfitsio.a
      b) FFTW_* points to the fftw3 library.
      c) F77 is the Fortran compiler to be used.

2) In terminal run:
      cd src/
      make clean
      make 

This should generate MockCubeGenerator and place it in /Programs
