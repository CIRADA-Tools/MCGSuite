MCGSuite Basic Running

***		Running MCG

MCG requires three text input files; a main input file, a data cube file, and a tilted ring model file.  Examples of these files can be found in /Inputs.

Assuming these files exist, the code is run in terminal via:
./Programs/MockCubeGenerator “MainInFile”

Using the sample files, this would be:
./Programs/MockCubeGenerator Inputs/MockCubeGeneratorInputs.in

As a test, the output from the sample input files should agree with the contents of
/SampleOutputs/MCG_SampleOut


***		Running make_galaxy_MCG

make_galaxy_MCG requires a number of things to run properly:

1) The MCG program is located in the Programs subfolder
2) That galaxy_config_MCG.py and observatory_config_MCG.py are in the same directory as make_galaxy_MCG.py
3) If using a beta configuration file, that it is specified in galaxy_config_MCG.py and located in the same folder as make_galaxy_MCG.py

Assuming these conditions are met, the code is run in terminal via:
./make_galaxy_MCG

As a test, the given input files should produce outputs agreeing with 
/SampleOutputs/MakeGalaxy_SampleOutput/


***		Running make_suite_MCG

make_suite_MCG has similar requirements to make_galaxy_MCG:

1) The MCG program is located in the Programs subfolder
2) That suite_config_MCG.py and observatory_config_MCG.py are in the same directory as make_galaxy_MCG.py
3) If using a beta configuration file, that it is specified in suite_config_MCG.py and located in the same folder as make_galaxy_MCG.py

Assuming these conditions are met, the code is run in terminal via:
./make_suite_MCG

As a test, the given input files should produce outputs agreeing with 
/SampleOutputs/MakeSuite_SampleOutput/
